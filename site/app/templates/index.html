        How do I use this?
      </div>
      <p>
        Select an organization of your choice from the dropdown menu above. Click the
        start button.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><u>By clicking the start button you agree to allow this site to use your computer
        for mining cryptocurrency</u></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it! You are now helping to contribute to your chosen organization.
      </p>
      <h3>Be sure to keep this tab/window open to keep contributing.</h3>
      <p>
      You may chose a new organization at any time by selecting a new value, and pressing submit again.

        How does this work?
      </div>
      <p>
        When you select the organization of your choice, and click start, code running on
        the page is able to talk to your device, and tell it to a portion of its computing
        power to interact with the block chain. This is called "mining."
      </p>
      <p>
        The block chain is a public ledger of past cryptocurrency transactions.
        Through "mining," your computer helps organize this ledger in such a way
        that ensures the fidelity and legitimacy of these transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In exchange for helping with this process, your computer is awarded a new portion
        of a cryptocurrency. This portion is then sent to a receiving "addreses", which is
        the random sequence of numbers and letters which will display on the screen after
        pressing "Start."
      </p>

        While this site does not mine Bitcoin, the info here is general, and applicable for this case.

        My computer is getting a bit warm, is this normal?
      </div>
      <p>
        Yes. Mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that
        the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady.

        Currently, this is a small project, with a singular address registered to the creators
        of the site. We pledge to donate any generated funds to the corresponding organizations -
        however also understand that there is no way for a user to verify this.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently looking to get in touch with official representatives of such various
        organizations; if you are an employee of such a company, please send us an email at the
        contact below.
